## Setup your development

QuickStart.


### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
