1.  in respect of any Creator Data, procure and ensure that the relevant data subjects:

1.  for which there are no Documentation or for which Mulerun reasonably believes there are no Documentation; or
    
2.  in a way that does not comply with the terms hereunder or Applicable Data Protection Laws,
    

provided that Mulerun notifies the Creator of such refusal in writing stating its reasons. Any such refusal shall be a breach of the DPA or ToS or constitute a basis for the Creator to allege that Mulerun has repudiated this DPA or ToS.

<h3><u>5. Mulerun’s Obligations</u></h3>

5.1 Mulerun shall only process Creator Data (including with regard to data transfers) in accordance with, and for the purposes documented in this DPA and any further written instructions from the Creator documented and agreed by Mulerun as constituting further instructions.

5.2 Mulerun is hereby granted your general authorisation to engage third party subcontractors to process the Creator Data for the Permitted Purpose and shall maintain an up-to-date list of such subcontractors here, and shall impose data protection terms on any subcontractor it appoints to process any Creator Data, that require it to protect such Creator Data to at least the standard required by applicable Data Protection Law, or the provisions of this DPA, whichever is more protective. 

5.3 At your request, delete or return all Creator Data in Mulerun’s possession following the termination of the ToS. This requirement shall not apply to the extent that Mulerun is required or permitted by applicable law to retain some or all of the Creator Data, in which event Mulerun shall securely isolate and protect such Creator Data from any further processing except: (i) to the extent required by such law until deletion is possible; or (ii) where such Data ceases to contain personal data.

5.4 Mulerun shall implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures for the protection of Creator Data. 

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein obliges Mulerun to disclose any information that is subject to any right, privilege or immunity conferred, or obligation (including without limitation in connection with Mulerun's performance of any contractual obligation) or limitation imposed, by or under any law or rules of professional conduct in relation to the disclosure of such information.

<h3><u>6. Indemnity</u></h3>

6.1 Without prejudice to the indemnity obligations already covered in the ToS, Creator agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Mulerun harmless from and against any and all suits, actions, claims or proceedings arising from an actual or potential breach of this DPA or Applicable Data Protection Laws by Creator and/or Users, or any regulatory, private lawsuit or governmental action relating to any processing of Creator Data.

<h3><u>7. Miscellaneous</u></h3>

7.1 This DPA shall remain in force for the duration of the ToS. This DPA forms an integral part of the ToS.

7.2 Unless indicated otherwise, if there is any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this DPA and the remainder of the ToS, this DPA shall prevail to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency.

7.3 This DPA and any dispute or claim in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the governing law of the ToS, for which this DPA forms a part thereof. The Creator hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the dispute resolution venue(s) as set out in the ToS.
